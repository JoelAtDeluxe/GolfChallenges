## My Solution

* Language(s): [Python]

My solution was a really straight forward loop. Even the golfed version is super readable. I considered a RE, but an obvious one didn't jump out oat me.

## Evaluation

* Performance: Unsubmitted (too obvious)

Looks like all of the answers used a regex, and were otherwise equally easy.
